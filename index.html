    							<h2>Banda Filarmónica Santa Maria Xochixtepec</h2>
    							<p>With the help of Alberto Montellano Mazas, a well-respected musician, native of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag, Oaxaca, “Banda Filarmónica Santa Maria Xochixtepec” began their first music lessons in 1978. The first students who became part of the formation of the band were community members that settled in Los Angeles, California, along with eager first generation Xochixtepec Oaxaqueno- Americans, yearning to understand the traditional music that made their family so proud. And with time, the band began to thrive and interested children of settled migrants joined this wonderful tradition. To this day, the band is currently in their fourth generation of musicians who are learning music. The band is proud to say that it is formed by either natives or descendants of Santa Maria Xochixtepec.</p>

    							<h2>Banda Yatzachi el Bajo, Los Angeles</h2>
    							<p>San Baltazar Yatzachi el Bajo (YEB) is one of 25 municipalities that form the district of Villa Alta in the northern region of the Sierra Mountains of Oaxaca, Mexico. Today, the town of Yatzachi el Bajo has a population of approximately 90 people. This number is a result of heavy migration to other parts of Mexico and to the United States. The city of Los Angeles is today home to a thriving Oaxacan population, which includesmembers of the Yatzachi el Bajo community. The earliest arrivals from YEB date as far back as the 1950s. By the mid 1970s, they had established a tightknit YEB community that began working to aid their hometown as well as finding ways to preserve and celebrate their traditions in their new environment.</p>
